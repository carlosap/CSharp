            <h3>TIME-TO-DIGITAL CONVERTERS, MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS & CUSTOMIZED SENSOR SOLUTIONS</h3>
            <p>
            Precision Measurement Technologies is a Technology Center and are experts in AMS products including the Acam family of products which specializes in high resolution time-to-digital converters. AMS/Acam products produce advanced time-to-digital converters and measurement systems for time-of-flight (TOF), laser applications, digital strain-gage, capacitance, and speed sensors as well as stand-alone assemblies. Time-to-digital converters replace traditional ADCâ€™s (analog-to-digital converters) for lower production cost and faster design cycles. The PMT Technology Center works with customers and applications for the AMS standard products as well. Including the VOC sensors, Air Quality Sensors, POS Magnetic Positioning Sensors, Lighting Detector Sensors, Lighting Sensors, Audio Noise Canceling Sensors, Temperature and Humidity Sensors. We work with customers on Proof of Concept Designs, help with Evaluation Systems and Register Settings to speed up the development and optimize the product to a specific application all the way through into production.
