    ASP.NET Core is a new open-source and cross-platform framework for building modern
    cloud based internet connected applications, such as web apps, IoT apps and mobile
    backends. ASP.NET Core apps can run on .NET Core or on the full .NET Framework.
    It was architected to provide an optimized development framework for apps that are
    deployed to the cloud or run on-premises. It consists of modular components with
    minimal overhead, so you retain flexibility while constructing your solutions.
    You can develop and run your ASP.NET Core apps cross-platform on Windows, Mac and
    Linux. ASP.NET Core is open source at GitHub.
